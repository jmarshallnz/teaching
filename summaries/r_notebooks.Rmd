## Introduction

An R notebook is a document produced using markdown, a simple way to add formatting to plain text (similar to HTML). You can incorporate R code and output by using special codeblocks. They're ideal summaries of a set of analysis that you can give to someone else (perhaps your future self) to help remember both what was done and what the results were.

The idea is that by including commentary and analysis code in the same document, your report is **reproducible**, so that if the data should change at a later date you can re-generate the report and the results will automatically update.

## Key things to remember

1. There's a block of special text (the metadata) at the top where you put the title, author, date etc, plus special formatting options (which we probably won't use). It is delineated by the three dashes above and below the block. RStudio pre-fills this for you whenever you create a new R markdown document. One thing to note is that you should place your title/author etc in quotes - that way any special characters will be ignored. e.g. use something like:

    ```
    ---
    title: "My awesome title"
    author: "Me!"
    date: "Today"
    ---
    ```

2. R code blocks are defined using:

    ````
    ```{r}`r ''`
    # some code goes here
    ```
    ````

    A common error is to have a code block that doesn't finish (e.g. the three backtick marks aren't in place) - you can usually pick this up because RStudio formats the code blocks using different text.

3. Your markdown document must be self-contained: i.e. it must not rely on things outside of itself: any data it needs must be read in during an R code block. If you get an error during compilation that you don't get while running codeblocks in RStudio, then it is probably due to you relying on a variable or object in your current environment that isn't defined further up in the markdown file. One way to figure it out is to clear your Environment using the broom icon (top right) and then run the codeblocks one by one until you find the error.

## Special formatting

In markdown, anything you type normally will be interpreted as if it is just a sentence, but you can add embellishments and they'll be formatted up nicely in your report.

### Paragraph separation

A blank line separates paragraphs (i.e. two carriage returns). You might find you need a blank line after some R output (e.g. a plot) to avoid it starting text to the right of a plot.

### Headings and sub-headings

Headings and sub-heading can be done by using a number of hash characters: The more hashes, the smaller the heading. e.g.

```
this is a plain sentence.

# This is big heading

## This is a sub-heading

### This is a sub-sub-heading

#### And an even smaller one!
```

### Lists of bullet points

Bullet points can be achieved by just having a list in your that begins with a suitable marker, such as an asterisk or dash. Sub-bullets can be done by indenting the block by 4 spaces. Numbered bullets just use the numbers as you'd expect.

```
- A bullet point.
- Another bullet point.
- Another bullet.
    - A sub-bullet.
    - Another sub-bullet.

1. A numbered list starts here
2. Another numbered item
```

### Emphasis

You can make text *italic* or **bold** by surrounding text with single or double asterisks:

```
This demonstrates *italics* and **bold** emphasis. Some people even ***italic bold***!!
```
